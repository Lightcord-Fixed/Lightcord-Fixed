Hello! I'm Kai I'm a Fifteen year old student looking into a way to fix Lightcord without the use of displunger, The links to these two projects are below.
I have practiced coding since i was 13, I'm an expert at C++, Lua, and Assembly.
I used lightcord when it was active and working, but now it really doesn't work and is broken.
After I realized the developers werent working on it, i felt sad, wondering why I just decided "I'll learn coding, so I can fix it!" and soon enough it'll be done. (hopefully)
